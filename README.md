# Exercise delivery of Simulazione Numerica by Alessandro Giorgi

This repository is orginzed in folders with an exercise each one and a review of the work with my analysis.

To compile C++ programs :
```C
    make compila
```

and to run them:
```C
    make esegui
```

Last two exercises are written in Google Collab and so they have some lines which mounts my personal Drive to save plots.
